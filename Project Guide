This manual will provide a guide on how to use the four code files, including the user interface.


Navigating through the code files:
1. Name: main.py
    Simulation Runner
    - This contains the heat system class which is used to 
    - Using File 2 (main.py), the user interface is called in to run the simulation based on the user's requirements.
    - By running this file, the user interface can be accessed.
2. Name: heat_system.py
    Simulation Runner
    - This file contains the user interface, which is called upon in other code files to run their respective simulations.
    - This file is not meant to be run on its own, instead it is run as a part of Code Files 1 & 3.
3. Code File 3: Optimisation
    - This is where optimal parameters are found for each house location
    - Running this code will produce plots of the performance metrics against the different parameters.
    - Each plot would print an optimal parameter value.
4. Code File 4: Method Improvement (Hot Water Draw-off)
    - This is where the simulation is altered to include realistic hot water usage patterns.
    - Running this would give access to the user interface but this time with hot water draw-offs included.





-----------------------------------

Step-by-step guide for User Interface:
1. Select the city in which you would like to situate the building.
2. Click "Update temperature".
3. Select one of the buildings to set the appropriate system parameters:
    Building A: a well-insulated, smaller home.
    Building B: a moderately insulated, medium-sized home.
    Building C: a poorly-insulated, larger house.
    Building D: the default building given in the ‘input.yaml’ file.
    Alternatively, manually enter the desired parameters.
4. Select "Run Simulation"
5. If you wish to inspect any performance metrics across the 24h period, choose one of three options under "Select Performance Metric" and then select "Run Simulation"
