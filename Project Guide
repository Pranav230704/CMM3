This manual will provide a guide on how to use the four code files, including the user interface.

Navigating through the code files:

1. Name: main.py
    Simulation Runner
    - 
2. Name: heat_system.py
    Class for Heat System Simulation
    - This contains the heat system class 
    - This file is called upon by code file 1 (main.py) to run the simulation
    - File not inteded to be run on its own
3. Name: Optimisation
    - This is where optimal parameters are found for each house location
    - 
4. Name: Method Improvement
    - This is where the simulation is altered to include realistic hot water usage patterns.

-----------------------------------

Step-by-step guide for User Interface (this is also shown in the UI itself to refer back between steps if necessary):

1. Select the city in which you would like to situate the building.
2. Click "Update temperature".
3. Select one of the buildings to set the appropriate system parameters:
    Building A: a well-insulated, smaller home.
    Building B: a moderately insulated, medium-sized home.
    Building C: a poorly-insulated, larger house.
    Building D: the default building given in the ‘input.yaml’ file.
    Alternatively, manually enter the desired parameters.
4. Select "Run Simulation"
5. If you wish to inspect any performance metrics across the 24h period, choose one of three options under "Select Performance Metric" and then select "Run Simulation"
