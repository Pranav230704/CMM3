This manual will provide a guide on how to use the four code files, including the user interface.


Navigating through the code files:

1. Name: main.py
    Simulation Runner
    - The simuation is run here, including the user interface
    - Run this code to open the UI
    - Instructions on how to use the UI can be found below and in the UI itself
    - This files calls in file 2 (heat_system.py) to obtain the tank temperature values by solving the ODE
2. Name: heat_system.py
    Class for Heat System Simulation
    - This contains the heat system class 
    - This file is called upon by code file 1 (main.py) to run the simulation
    - File not inteded to be run on its own
3. Name: Optimisation
    - This is where optimal parameters were found for each house location
    - Running this code will print the optimal set of parameters for the location set at the start of the code
    - The total energy consumption of the optimal tank/house system is also printed
4. Name: Method Improvement
    - This is where the simulation was altered to include realistic hot water usage patterns.
    - Running this code will produce plots of tank temperature against time for each of the days:
        1) a typical weekday
        2) Saturday
        3) a holiday such as Christmas
    - For comparison, a plot of tank temperature vs time is also given for the system before altering for hot water usage patterns


Step-by-step guide for User Interface (this is also shown in the UI itself to refer back between steps if necessary):

1) Select one of the preset buildings (via the dropdown menu) to set the appropriate system parameters:
    
    House A: A well-insulated, smaller home.
    House B: A moderately insulated, medium-sized home.
    House C: A poorly-insulated, larger house.
    YAML: The default building configuration.
    
    The inputs will be automatically filled based on the selected building.
    
2) You can edit the parameters to suit your needs. If you change the city for outside temperature, click 'Update Temperature' to refresh the temperature values.

3) Click the 'Run Simulation' button to simulate the heat pump performance and see the results.
    
4) If you wish to start again, click reset and everything will be set to 0 for you to input values again
